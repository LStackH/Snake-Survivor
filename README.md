# Snake Survivor
Terminal based snake game, with simple ASCII graphics.
Built with C and Ncurses

Watch out for the shooting farmer!

# Installation Guidelines
## Prerequisites
* **Linux terminal**
* **GCC** (if you wish to compile yourself)
* **Ncurses library** (for development)


## Installation
1. ``` git clone https://github.com/LStackH/Snake-Survivor.git ```
2. ``` cd Snake-Survivor ```
3. ``` ./snake ```
4. Enjoy

## Troubleshooting
* **The game won't run after step 3.**
     - You may need to make the binary executable: ``` chmod +x snake ```

* **Game and borders mis-drawn**
     - The game needs a minimum screen size, so you will need to make the terminal larger.
     - For the best experience, terminal should be full screen
